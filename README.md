## 📊 Methodology

## 1️⃣ Data Collection
The dataset was created from a Google Form survey where students and staff reflected on life.
Responses were collected in text format for Natural Language Processing (NLP) analysis.
## 2️⃣ Data Preprocessing
Tokenization: Splitting text into words.
Stopword Removal: Removing common words like "the", "is", "and".
Punctuation Elimination: Removing unnecessary symbols to clean the text.
## 3️⃣ Sentiment Analysis
The syuzhet package was used to classify words as positive, negative, or neutral.
A sentiment score was calculated for each response to determine overall sentiment trends.
## 4️⃣ Data Visualization
WordCloud: Displays the most frequently used words in the dataset.
Pie Chart: Shows the overall distribution of sentiments.



## 🚀 Future Improvements
✅ Expand the dataset to include more diverse responses.
✅ Implement machine learning models for more accurate sentiment classification.
✅ Conduct a comparative analysis over different time periods.
